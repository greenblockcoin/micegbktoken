Blockchain based cryptocurrency and Ecosystem backed by the Hemp &amp; Cannabis industry.

Blockchain Based Traceability for the hemp and cannabis Industry In order to address the
needs of the many stakeholders involved such as growers, processors, retailers, consumers,
exporters, and even governments, the hemp and cannabis industry needs an interoperable
system that is able to provide the appropriate data for each respective entity in a way that is
trusted, transparent, and secure. Blockchain presents an ideal solution for many of these
challenges, while a token ecosystem solves the essential challenge of creating appropriate
incentives for those making the extra effort to capture data.
Greenblock Ecosystem
In this respect, the Greenblock Ecosystem creates a mechanism for rewarding hemp and
cannabis producers and supply chain intermediaries through micro-transactions, creating a
virtuous cycle for sustainable practices that extends beyond government mandates for
traceability. Greenblock tokens are not meant to be a currency for trading hemp and cannabis.
Instead, Greenblock tokens provide a mechanism for incentivizing data capture and
transmission in various forms. Incentivizing Data Capture within Supply Chains By creating
the appropriate reward structure for data capture along with an interoperable platform, the
Greenblock Ecosystem will allow for makers of third party tools such as Internet of Things
(IoT) sensors and other data inputs to participate in the ecosystem and be rewarded
accordingly. This will drive more data feeds into the ecosystem and ultimately allow hemp
and cannabis buyers to have a better understanding of the actual metrics that impact safety
and quality, including, but not limited to, conditions from harvest to consumption, and
pesticide and toxins screening. The end result will be hemp and cannabis buyers having the
right quantity and quality of information to make better decisions, governments being better
able to manage the industry using up to date data, and producers and intermediaries being
rewarded for data capture and responsible behavior. The Importance of Understanding Real
Trade While there are other blockchain based traceability platforms that have emerged to
address the very real supply chain problems that span industries, the hemp and cannabis
industry in particular has unique needs that can only be addressed by those with insider
knowledge based on the realities of actual trade. This is where the Greenblock team is
uniquely qualified to design and develop the Greenblock Ecosystem because of their decades
of experience advising and trading in the hemp and cannabis industry.
